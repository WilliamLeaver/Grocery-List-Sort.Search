# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This program takes in a list of items that have been sold by a company and returns how many of each item was purchased. It also includes a search and a basic histogram feature.

What did you do particularly well?
- I feel that in this program my blending c++ and python really shines. When I was writing this program I had little trouble getting the python functions to call properly in c++.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- This program could be improved by introducing new libraries to make better histograms. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I would say out of all of this program remembering the python syntax took me a second. I just used stackoverflow to find answers. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- Blending different languages will be important in a career for sure. Also keeping my main function from getting clogged up with code and writing functions will be transferable.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- By seperating code into functions that are easy to read and follow. The switch statment in the menu function allows for easy addition of more menu items without having to re write any error handling code.
